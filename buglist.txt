be careful when copying codes
be careful when transforming: what is changing?
edge cases (end or start)
perform order, like divide and multiply
are the conditions enough?
when iterating, previous affect follows?
think about greedy carefully, like direction
try other possibilities
iterate different things
ABABABAB => A BABABA B
messing row and column
no handling input
add mod before minus
i-=2 and i=-2
precalculation
overflow
init segment tree backward
there are may be 2+ bugs
break the group
net cost makes any difference?
read carefully (data range)
reuse calculated results
initial value?
multiple vs gcd
